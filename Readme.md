# Blockchain Visualization

Simple Blockchain Visualization based off Bitcoin Core JSON RPC API

Forked from Blockchain App Template makevoid/roda_bitcoin

uses bitcoin's JSON RPC API


# Setup

    bundle


# Run

    bundle exec rackup

or

    rackup


Dao to vote to choose the proof of concept will be the first

pair-up blockchain and crypto assets with most existing

ideally develop something that is pluggable, at least on both Ethereum and Bitcoin


my favourite project is this IPFSPlay
Kristina's favourite project is Solether

will be cool to use Oraclize

I had the idea that Oraclize has developed

I implemented the same thing for Electric Skateboards Forum

a Bitcoin tip bot - but instead
also, right now it's just the testing phase of the funds, basically alert that he has some funds unused for a while, and he should


Also SMSWallet
  centralized or decentralized (via other services using multisig, contacted via api) wallet that saves the private key


More hardware projects

Smart lock
- bike
- locker (possibility to trade goods by using crypto) <<<<<<<<<<
- car
- house

- autonomous airbnb
- autonomous

- autonomous electric


The DAO small

https://github.com/makevoid/solether



----

The idea is to be small by myself and then in the future to hire a team that can help build those apps

The final program will be something to do this dao autonomously so that's it's not


build apps automatically

automatically registering to services like aws or bitcoin-payable-hosts to get hosting

pays bitcoin for resources - gets services
pays for programmers - starts an hackands session, gives the programmer an already preconfigured

hires people form mechanical turk and/or from a bitcoin-based-micro-task
service

Does a/b testing by hired people that will tell the program something that he can't know, more that clearly inputted values that gets rendered somewhere under the correct conditions.


Something like what's the best UIs in terms of first impression for example. Something that the machines and code can't do at the moment, or reallty cannot do it very well.

Basically it lets you build an application, or builds parts, or plugs in some existing solution and improves it by implementing crypto currencies and blockchain programming.
